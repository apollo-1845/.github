# üöÄ Welcome to Apollo 1845! üöÄ
Not a NASA moon mission from the distant future. Not a Victorian revival of Ancient Greek religion. Just a group of people trying to run code in space!
### Sorry, what?
We're a group of teams entering the [Astro Pi: Mission Space Lab](https://astro-pi.org/mission-space-lab/) competition run by the Raspberry Pi Foundation and the European Space Agency.

### 2021
* üéà [Team B](https://github.com/apollo-1845/2021-Team-B) ([Post processing](https://github.com/apollo-1845/2021-Team-B-post-processing))- Determining the concentration of greenhouse gases using NDVI in different parts of the earth‚Äôs atmosphere and mapping the earth‚Äôs magnetic field to determine how its strength and shape changes according to topographical features. 
* üå≥ [knowNDVI](https://github.com/apollo-1845/2021-knowNDVI) ([Post processing](https://github.com/apollo-1845/2021-knowNDVI-post-processing)) - Calculating plant health (NDVI) on Earth and comparing it to factors from NASA datasets and datasets we create, like air pollution, population density, temperature, humidity, daylight time, cloud cover, longitude and latitude, to get an idea of how limiting factors work on a large scale. 
* ‚òÅ [Cloud9](https://github.com/apollo-1845/2021-Cloud9) Investigating how location, altitude, land type and plant health affect cloud distribution. _(did not reach phase 3 - code ran with error)_
